There are three methods I had experimented with. 1. Using dense neural network based system , 2. Using XGBRegressor from the XGBoost Module, 3. Item based collaborative filtering script implemented from scratch

The best results were returned by the second method using XGBregssor with extensive feature engineering

Training data: Subset of the yelp dataset
Testing data: Subset of yelp dataset, self created sample
